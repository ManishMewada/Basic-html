        In HTML, you use the <img> tag to add images to websites. It is an inline and empty element, which means that it doesn't start on a new line and doesn't take a closing tag.
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
        The img tag takes several attributes, of which src, height, width, and alt are the most important.The src attribute signifies the image source. Without it, the tag itself wouldn't be functional in the real world.
